# gbpxl

**Game Boy Printer XL**

An *invisible* interface between Game Boy Camera and ESC/POS compatible printers.
Improvements, suggestions, experience with various printer models are welcome!

## How to use it

Build your **gbpxl** using kit (see below).

*or*

**Download the code** from this repository and build it yourself using **Arduino Nano Every** and **TTL-RS232** converter.

## gbpxl kit

**Kit contains:**
 * all electronic parts, including pre-programmed ATmega4809
 * PCB (ENIG surface)
 * Game Boy link cable (half), RJ12 cable for power
 * DB25 connector, plastic cover, screws
 
**Available here:**
 * link coming soon

**How it looks:**

## Tested with these printers
Originally intended only for Epson TM-T88 family, but it should work with *most* ESC/POS printers by selecting different DIP settings.

| Printer             | DIP3  | DIP4  |                            
|:--------------------|:-----:|:-----:|
|Epson TM-T88III      |   OFF | ON    |
|Epson TM-T88IV       |   ON  | ON    |
|Wincor Nixdorf TH230 |   ON  | OFF   |
|HPRT PPTII-A         |   OFF | OFF   |


## gbpxl DIP switch settings

|     | DIP1: Scale | DIP2: Cut | DIP3: Baud rate | DIP4: Method   |
|-----|:-----------:|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| ON  |   3x        | Yes       | 38400           | GS             |
| OFF |   2x        | No        | 9600            | ESC \*         |

### Scale
 * 2x scale is intended for 58 mm thermal printers
 * 3x scale is intended for 80 mm thermal printers

### Cut
Cuts the paper after printing each photo. (Some cheaper printers doesn't support it.)

### Baud rate
Must be the same as selected by the printer (see the manual). If you are not sure, try 9600.
 * Epson TM-T88 family: DIP switches under metal cover on the bottom.
 * Wincor Nixdorf TH230: Selected in the menu (the menu is activated by holding Feed button while powering the printer on).

### GS method
 * "Gs v 0" if baudrate 9600
 * "Gs ( L" if baudrate 38400


## How to wire the board

### Game Boy Link Connector
Cable at the end which plugs into the Game Boy.

```
  ___________
 |  6  4  2  |                
  \_5__3__1_/     
                            
2. SO (serial output)       |  BROWN*
3. SI (serial input)        |  GREEN*
4. SC (serial clock)        |  BLUE*
6. GND                      |  RED*
```

\*Color codes for cheap Game Boy Color link cable, which you can buy on eBay etc.
  
### RJ-12 connector (power from printer's "DK" port)
Cable at the end which plugs into the printer.

```
  ___________
 |           |
 |___________|
  | | | | | |
  1 2 3 4 5 6 

1. GND 
3. VIN (24 V)
```
Gbpxl board supports 10-30 V as VIN voltage.
 
### ...if using Arduino Every
  
  * SO = Arduino pin 4
  * SI = Arduino pin 3
  * SC = Arduino pin 2
  
 Don't connect RJ-12 to Arduino Nano Every, it's VIN input supports 21 V max!
 
 ## Programming gbpxl
 
Since gbpxl uses ATmega4809, the programming must be done via **UPDI** interface, you can't use just your regular USBasp or similar. The UPDI connector uses the pinout based on **[microUPDI project](https://github.com/MCUdude/microUPDI)**, which also includes TX/RX connections for easy communication with PC - useful for transfering images etc.

Sadly, since the UPDI is quite new, there are no cheap programmers available yet, but you can build the **[microUPDI](https://github.com/MCUdude/microUPDI)** or **[jtag2updi](https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi)** quite easily by yourself. When uploading, specify "Arduino Nano Every" as your pinout.
